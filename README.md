To take the collection / archive to the person, to inform and educate and to foster and develop interest in history through the collection by drawing their attention to local historical sites, objects, events. 

How: Generate interest in the collections by automatically harvesting information from the archive and posting as stories on peoples Facebook newsfeed and/or other social media. Opening people up to historical sites, objects, events in their surrounding area and encouraging them to delve deeper and to share their interest.

Each region / län to have it’s own Facebook page, by liking that page you will receive regular ‘news’ items relating to history in the region. These will be drawn from Platser.

Create an automated story generator, selecting stories/photos/ form the archive, specifically Platser.

Who: anyone but specifically those with a passing interest in history, focusing on local history.

This needs to be low cost with minimal human involvement. 

Best outcome: to have a fully automated history story generator pulling well written and interesting stories from the archive.

Problems: 

1. No of stories in each region. There are over 4000 stories on Platser, these are unevenly shared around the country, for example there are over 200 in Stockholm alone but only 17 in the whole of Norrbottens län. If we create a page for each region some pages will quickly begin to repeat themselves.

Solution(s): 

Use different sources in combination with Platser for example ‘sagenkartor’ www.sprakochfolkminnen.se or use ww.kringla.nu which both use maps to locate stories, sounds and objects to locations.

Have fewer pages: one page for the whole of Sweden or one page for a number of counties.


2. How the information / stories are presented / written on Platser. There are 4526 of interesting local historical sites around Sweden listed on Platser 4516 of which have ‘stories’ attached to them, however the written information linked to these sites though interesting and useful in itself is not often suitable to be used as a ‘story’ in a Facebook feed. For this idea to work the source material needs to be more ‘journalistic’ in style.

Solution(s): 

Allow the bot to select stories randomly and measure the online response (shares, likes) taking down stories that don’t do well.

Have a moderator to check the stories for content and quality.

Use more / different sources.
